I am a statistician based in Munich, Germany. I hold a Master’s degree in statistics and a Bachelor’s degree in economics. I am interested in all things related to data analysis, e.g. statistics, data science, machine learning, deep learning.

Beyond modeling and predicting I think it is also important to interpret results (machine learning interpretability, eXplainable AI) and consider economic and social implications of a data driven world.

In my spare time, I make electronic music and play the piano. I enjoy going for a hike or on a bicycle tour through the Alps. Besides, I regularly go swimming and play / watch football (aka soccer) and chess.
