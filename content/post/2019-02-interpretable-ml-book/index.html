<p>The introduction covers three short stories that illustrate the detrimental consequences of
a world controlled by black box machine learning models
(<a href="https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/storytime.html">1.1</a>).
They serve as motivation for why we want to use methods
that improve understanding of an opaque model.
The goal is that a human can understand a model
so that he can consistently predict its results.</p>
<p><a href="https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/interpretability.html">Chapter 2</a>
lays the foundation for the discussion on machine learning interpretability
by answering the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why is interpretation important and when do we need it
(<a href="https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/interpretability-importance.html">2.1</a>)?</li>
<li>How can we classify different interpretation methods
(<a href="https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/taxonomy-of-interpretability-methods.html">2.2</a>)?
<ul>
<li>intrinsic vs post-hoc methods</li>
<li>result of the method</li>
<li>model-specific vs model-agnostic</li>
<li>local vs global</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Which part of a model do we want to inspect
(<a href="https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/scope-of-interpretability.html">2.3</a>)?</li>
<li>How do we evaluate the interpretation
(<a href="https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/evaluation-of-interpretability.html">2.4</a>)?</li>
<li>What does a human need to know to understand a black box model
(<a href="https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/explanation.html">2.6</a>)?</li>
</ul>
<p>The presented interpretation methods are repeatedly applied to three freely available data sets
representing different kinds of prediction tasks:
<a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset">daily bike rentals</a> (regression),
<a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Cervical+cancer+%28Risk+Factors%29">cancer risk factors</a> (classification) and
<a href="dcomp.sor.ufscar.br/talmeida/youtubespamcollection/">YouTube spam comments</a> (text classification).
<a href="https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/data.html">Chapter 3</a>
introduces the datasets in more detail.</p>

<h2>Interpretable models</h2>
<p>This chapter presents models that are interpretable by itself.
For Molnar these are</p>
<ul>
<li>linear regression</li>
<li>logistic regression</li>
<li>decision trees</li>
<li>decision rules</li>
<li>RuleFit (<a href="http://statweb.stanford.edu/~jhf/ftp/RuleFit.pdf">Friedman and Popescu, 2005</a>)</li>
<li>naive Bayes</li>
<li>k-nearest neighbors</li>
</ul>
<p>These models have in common that the result is accessible to the user without further steps.
They differ in regards to linearity, monotonicity,
the possibility to include feature interactions and
the tasks they can handle.</p>
<p>The interpretation of linear regression is straightforward.
We compute a coefficient (or a weight in ML terminology) for each feature
that tells us how much the predicted target increases
if we increase the corresponding feature by one unit, all other features held constant.

can help to understand a featureâ€™s contribution to the prediction.</p>
