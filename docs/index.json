The method I propose in my Master’s thesis tries to improve understanding of these black boxes. The goal is to find a way to quantify effect sizes of features. Average marginal effects are used in social sciences to determine effect sizes of logistic regression models. Applying this method to a machine learning model usually does not adequately represent the non-convex, non-monotonic response function. There are graphical methods like partial dependence plots or accumulated local effect plots that visualize the response functions but do not offer a quantitative interpretation. First, we use one of the latter methods to identify intervals within the response function is relatively stable. Second, we report some estimate of the feature effect separately for each interval. Our method determines the number of necessary intervals automatically.\n Example: Bike Sharing Data The following examples shows how the method can help to understand heterogeneous feature effects. We apply the method to the Bike Sharing dataset (Fanaee-T and Gama 2013) which was further processed by Molnar (2018). See table 1 for an overview of all the features. The target cnt is the number of bicycles lent by a bicycle sharing company per day. The features comprise calendrical and meteorological information for each day.\n Table 1: Excerpt of the Bike Sharing dataset  season yr mnth holiday weekday weathersit temp hum windspeed cnt days_since_2011    SPRING 2011 JAN 0 SAT MISTY 8.18 80.6 10.8 985 0  SPRING 2011 JAN 0 SUN MISTY 9.08 69.6 16.7 801 1  SPRING 2011 JAN 0 MON GOOD 1.23 43.7 16.6 1349 2  SPRING 2011 JAN 0 TUE GOOD 1.40 59.0 10.7 1562 3  SPRING 2011 JAN 0 WED GOOD 2.67 43.7 12.5 1600 4  SPRING 2011 JAN 0 THU GOOD 1.60 51.8 6.0 1606 5    Model Training We use a linear model (R Core Team 2019), an SVM (Meyer et al. 2019), a random decision forest (Breiman et al. 2018) and gradient boosting (Greenwell et al. 2019). We compare the performance of all models and the performance of predicting the mean for each observation on a hold-out test set (see table 2). The linear model performs relatively well but we can improve by using a more complex machine learning model even without extensive tuning.\n Table 2: Mean squared error, root mean squared log error, and R squared for hold-out test set   mean(y) lm svm rf gbm    mse 3.75e+06 5.30e+05 4.33e+05 4.22e+05 4.12e+05  rmsle 5.93e-01 2.36e-01 2.44e-01 2.61e-01 2.30e-01  rsq 0.00e+00 8.59e-01 8.85e-01 8.88e-01 8.90e-01     Analysis Now analyse how changing feature values influences the predicted number of bikes. We focus on the three numerical features temp (temperature in degree Celsius), hum (humidity in percent) and windspeed (in kilometers per hour). We apply our method to each of the complex models with default settings. The output in R looks as follows:\n## lm: ## temp hum windspeed ## 98.2 -13.7 -40.1 ## SVM (temp) ## [-5.221, 19.26) [19.26, 32.498] ## 128.11 3.87 ## SVM (hum) ## [18.792, 56.792) [56.792, 93.957] ## 7.19 -32.71 ## SVM (windspeed) ## [2.834, 14.876) [14.876, 34] ## -22.7 -64.7 ## RF (temp) ## [-5.221, 20.278) [20.278, 32.498] ## 104.5 -62.7 ## RF (hum) ## [18.792, 64.667) [64.667, 93.957] ## -1.18 -31.97 ## RF (windspeed) ## [2.834, 18.417) [18.417, 24.251) [24.251, 34] ## -16.46 -78.30 -1.64 ## GBM (temp) ## [-5.221, 16.792) [16.792, 26.075) [26.075, 32.498] ## 124.2 13.9 -239.7 ## GBM (hum) ## [18.792, 64.667) [64.667, 83.792) [83.792, 87.25) [87.25, 93.957] ## -3.86 -39.63 -227.00 91.19 ## GBM (windspeed) ## [2.834, 8.584) [8.584, 22.959) [22.959, 24.251) [24.251, 34] ## -5.32e+01 -1.85e+01 -5.04e+02 6.60e-14 The marginal effect of the linear model is equal to the model coefficients. So according to the model an increase of the temperature by 1° Celsius leads to a predicted increase of \\(98.188\\). rented bicycles per day. This seems plausible for an average day. The higher the temperature the more people are willing to go by bike. But one could easily imagine that a temperature rise on a hot day will make people less likely rent a bike to avoid physical exertion. This is exactly what the results of the complex models suggest. Below 20° the SVM predicts an increase of \\(128.106\\) bikes per day for an additional degree Celsius. Above 20° the effect becomes negative and very small \\((3.867)\\). The results of the random forest show two cutoff points. At around 13° the positive marginal effect becomes smaller in size and above 25° the effect is negative. The effect for gradient boosting is partitioned into four intervals. The effect of the three intervals below 27° are positive, above 27° it is negative, similarly to the results of the other two models. However, the absolute values of the effect fluctuate substantially for gradient boosting.\nFor humidity the linear model predicts a negative effect. For the SVM the effect is positive up to around 43%. Between 43% and 65% the effect is negative but smaller in size. Above 65% it is negative and four times bigger than in the previous interval. The results for the random forest and gradient boosting both show very small effects below roughly 65% humidity. Above this point both models predict a decrease of rented bicycles with rising humidity. The histogram (figure 1) explains why the effect for humidity is probably non-monotonic. Humidity usually is between 50% to 75%. Values outside this range indicate more extreme weather conditions. If uncommonly dry or wet air reduces people’s desire to ride a bike we will expect a positive effect on the number of rented bikes if humidity is below the familiar range, and a negative effect if it is above.\n Figure 1: Histogram for feature humidity of the Bike Sharing dataset.  Wind makes cycling less attractive, so one associates higher wind speed with a reduced willingness to rent a bike. The linear model predicts a negative effect (\\(-40.149\\)). For both SVM and random forest our method proposes a negative effect that is constant over the whole feature distribution. Consequently, in the case of wind speed a linear model seems to be appropriate to represent the relationship. Gradient boosting shows a negative effect for five intervals, the reported values are not very stable, again.\nIn this exemplary application we showed that the linear model does not suffice to represent the varying response function types. A user may come to wrong conclusions about the number of rented bikes depending on the weather conditions of the day. The proposed method enables the user to make quantitative statements as if he was using a linear model while preserving the non-linear, non-monotonic relationship where necessary. Thus, he can combine a better performing model with a comprehensible interpretation. The results for the gradient boosting model are less convincing. Due to the stepped response function the model is less appropriate for making quantitative statements about the feature effect. The estimates fluctuate between high values and values close to zero.\n Figure 2: Bike sharing data. Results SVM.   Figure 3: Bike sharing data. Results gradient boosting.

They serve as motivation for why we want to use methods that improve understanding of an opaque model. The goal is that a human can understand a model so that he can consistently predict its results.\nChapter 2 lays the foundation for the discussion on machine learning interpretability by answering the following questions:\n Why is interpretation important and when do we need it (2.1)? How can we classify different interpretation methods (2.2)?  intrinsic vs post-hoc methods result of the method model-specific vs model-agnostic local vs global  Which part of a model do we want to inspect (2.3)? How do we evaluate the interpretation (2.4)? What does a human need to know to understand a black box model (2.6)?  The presented interpretation methods are repeatedly applied to three freely available data sets representing different kinds of prediction tasks: daily bike rentals (regression), cancer risk factors (classification) and YouTube spam comments (text classification). Chapter 3 introduces the datasets in more detail.\nInterpretable models This chapter presents models that are interpretable by itself. For Molnar these are\n linear regression logistic regression decision trees decision rules RuleFit (Friedman and Popescu, 2005) naive Bayes k-nearest neighbors  These models have in common that the result is accessible to the user without further steps. They differ in regards to linearity, monotonicity, the possibility to include feature interactions and the tasks they can handle.\nThe interpretation of linear regression is straightforward. We compute a coefficient (or a weight in ML terminology) for each feature that tells us how much the predicted target increases if we increase the corresponding feature by one unit, all other features held constant.
